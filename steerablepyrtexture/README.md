# steerablepyrtexture: Steerable pyramid decomposition and texture analysis tools 

A modification pyrtools which is the Python 3 port of Eero Simoncelli's matlabPyrTools.
This version only includes the steerable pyramid portions of pyrtools and adds the texture
analysis function from their textureSynth MATLAB package. Additionally, to make the package
compatible with Windows the functions in C have been removed and replaced with python versions


## Dependencies

From steerablepyrtexture:
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - matplotlib
 - Pillow
 - tqdm
 - requests

# Usage:

To generate a texture feature vector from a 256x256 image use the command:

```
import steerablepyrtexture as spt
params = spt.texture_analyze(img, 5, 4, 7, vector_output=True)
```

This uses a 5 subband, 4 orientation steerable pyramid decomposition with a 7x7 square 
of entries around the center of the auto/cross-correlation matrices. 

The default output is a dictionary containing the parameter descriptors. Use vector output 
as a shortcut for generating a feature vector. With the settings shown above the output will 
be a vector with 2195 features (some of which will always be 0).
